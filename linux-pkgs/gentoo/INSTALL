This is a private overlay for Gentoo.
Right now it includes only one package - wmr-oregon.

To install it to Gentoo you have 2 chooses:

1. Install ebuild manually.
   - copy .ebuild file to you localhost
   - run 'ebuild <ebuild file> merge' to install it
   - to uninstall - run 'ebuild <ebuild file> unmerge'

2. Install it using an overlay manager.
   - add to the list of overlays this overlay.
	Example for 'layman':
	    # nano /etc/layman/layman.cfg
		    overlays  : http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/overlays/repositories.xml
	    +       		https://wmr.googlecode.com/svn/linux-pkgs/gentoo/wmr-oregon-overlay.xml
   - add this overlay to the system.
	Example for 'layman':
	    # layman -L; layman -a wmr-oregon
   - unmask the package
   - install/uninstall it as usual.
   
If you are planning to update the package, the second method is recommended.
