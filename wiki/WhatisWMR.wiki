= Details =

The *WMR/RMS/I* series from *_(c) Oregon Scientific_*, use a proprietary protocol for their USB connection. It's very useful for enthusiasts running a headless *Linux/FreeBSD* box to collect and analyze data from this link, but unfortunately the protocol isn't openly documented, nor are clients provided for this platform.

This simple *C* program handles the USB protocol of tested the WMR series, and translates it an ASCII line-format, easy for parsing/analysing.

You'll need to setup the udev rules (see udev/README) if you want to
run this not as root. This is due to how libhid accesses the USB
ports.
