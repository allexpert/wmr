=Introduction=
------------

The WMR/RMS/I series from Oregon Scientific, use a proprietary protocol for their USB
connection. It's very useful for enthusiasts running a headless Linux
box to collect and analyze data from this link, but unfortunately the
protocol isn't openly documented, nor are clients provided for this
platform.

This simple C program handles the USB protocol of the WMR100, and
translates it an ASCII line-format, easy for parsing/analysing.

You'll need to setup the udev rules (see udev/README) if you want to
run this not as root. This is due to how libhid accesses the USB
ports.
